## 📑Project description 
Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets: For this project we are challenged to buil a Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster (1) and which are not (0). 

## 📊 Data 
There is two datasets:
  df_train where we have 6471 rows and five columns.
  df_test where we have to applied our models to predict the "target" column
  
## 🎯 Project structure
**Preparation**
Create new GitHub repository
Create python notebook with Colab
Eda to see what we need to preprocessing

## 🧾 Results and solution

**Classifier:** Logisitic regression
**Parameters:** C = 2, ngram_range = (1,1), norm = 'l2'
**Accuracy:** 0.821
